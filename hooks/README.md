# Hooks in React

### Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.


__Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.__

## There are 3 rules for hooks:
1. **Hooks can only be called inside React function components.**
2. **Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.**
3. **Hooks cannot be conditional**

---


You must `import` Hooks from `react`.

#### **Note** : Hooks will not work in React class components.


## Different hooks name
